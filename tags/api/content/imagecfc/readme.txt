BUG REPORTS, FEATURER REQUESTS, HELP
------------------------------------
http://www.cfopen.org/projects/imagecfc

PLATFORMS SUPPORTED
-------------------
Operationgg Systems:  Windows, Linux - and probably all others.
Coldfusion Version 6.1 or higher (may work on 6.0)
Bluedragon Server, JX, or J2EE 6.2 or higher (may work on 6.1)

ImageCFC will NOT work on Bluedragon.NET, since it relies on java.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR HEADLESS SYSTEMS
---------------------------------
If you get a "cannot connect to X11 server" when running certain
parts of this component under Bluedragon (Linux), you must
add "-Djava.awt.headless=true" to the java startup line in
<bluedragon>/bin/StartBluedragon.sh.  This isssue is discussed
in the Bluedragon Installation Guide section 3.8.1 for
Bluedragon 6.2.1.

Bluedragon may also report a ClassNotFound exception when trying
to instantiate the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class.  This is
most likely the same issue.

If you get "This graphics environment can be used only in the
software emulation mode" when calling certain parts of this
component under Coldfusion MX, you should refer to Technote
ID #18747:  http://www.macromedia.com/go/tn_18747

SPECIAL NOTE FOR ADDTEXT() METHOD
---------------------------------
When you use the addText() method with a truetype font file, you 
will find that java creates temp files somewhere on your system.
In the Linux world, it seems to be /tmp and the files are named
JF*.tmp

These don't get cleaned up!!! You'll need to write some kind
of script to clean them up manually.  For example, I use
this as a cron job:

* * * * * /usr/bin/find /tmp -cmin +2 -name \*JF\*.tmp | /usr/bin/xargs /bin/rm
